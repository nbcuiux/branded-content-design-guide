                        <quote>ave you ever watched a show online and gotten annoyed by the seemingly endless commercials? Did you download an ad blocker plugin to your browser? More likely than not, you did.</quote>
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        It’s been estimated that if ad-blocking rates maintain at their current levels, then advertisers will lose $35 billion by 2020. According to a new report from PageFair, a company that helps advertisers regain revenue lost to ad blocking software, ad blocker usage surged 30% in 2016. By the end of 2016, there were 615 million devices blocking ads worldwide.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        After conducting a survey, PageFair found that the main reason U.S. consumers downloaded an ad blocker was due to virus and malware concerns (30%). The second top motivation was to prevent interruptions (29%).
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        We’re really focused on keeping up with the current digital landscape; upon review of Amazon Prime Video, we noticed how they used their X-Ray feature as a vehicle to advertise music. This novel approach piqued our curiosity. 
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        In the current digital space, one stymied by ad blockers and full of displeased consumers, the question of how to move forward in advertising remains unanswered. The traditional way of advertising can no longer withstand the test of time. Users are changing.

                          Streaming services with minimal ad content are being chosen over conventional cable providers. We began researching how different leading brands are dealing with the emerging advertising problem. More importantly, how are they working to sponsor brands without reverting to the traditional advertising protocol?
                        </p>

                       <p>
                        Upon diving deeper into Amazon Prime Video, we thought that they took a unique approach in answering this question. By incorporating music identification into X-Ray, Amazon led users to the purchasing space without infringing on the videoviewing experience. Good advertising is advertising you don’t notice at all. Inspired by this approach, we came up with our solution to the problem: V.ai.

                    Brands can now sponsor T.V. shows and movies to promote their products in a new and innovative way without using traditional commercials that interrupt and upset consumers.

                  Besides addressing the goal of advertising, V.ai aims to elevate the video viewing experience. Let’s be honest, most of us have pulled out our phones to google the charismatic protagonist in the middle of a movie before.

              <p>
                Music is a part of the video watching experience that people are interested in and, to be quite frank, we’re living during a time where opening and waiting for an app to listen to a song is simply too much work.

              <p>
                Consumers want their information and they want it fast. By automatically identifying music for users, we’re making their lives easier and we’re eliminating any unnecessary obstacles with a seamless experience.

                  Once the overlay is open, our array of advertising features is no more than a glance away. Advertising and e-commerce go hand in hand. We wanted to know what creates an enjoyable online shopping experience.

                  Our hefty research revealed that wishlists are one of the most important e-commerce features nowadays. Not only are wishlists vital for increasing sales by driving traffic, but they also dramatically improve the consumer experience.

                  Users want an opportunity to save items and easily return to them later. This is especially important when they’re watching their favorite show and don’t want any interruptions (yet they still want to buy the lead actress’s sunglasses).

                  Wishlists save precious browsing time and act as a handy, personalized checklist. We were inspired by the functionality of wishlists and aspired to go beyond.

                  We wanted to allow users to save not only products and songs, but we wanted users to get the chance to save characters and actors they want to read more about later.

                  Too caught up in the scandals to look up what else you’ve seen that actress in? Just star the actress to go back after the episode. The "starring" feature we’ve built into the player is a perfect example of how V.ai marries the e-commerce and video viewing experience.
